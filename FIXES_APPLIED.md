# Fixes Applied - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: LinkedIn Field Not Showing
**Problem**: LinkedIn URLs were in database but not visible in profile edit page

**Solution**: Added "Links to Monitor" section to profile edit page showing:
- LinkedIn URL
- Twitter Handle
- Company Domain

**Location**: `/app/people/[id]/page.tsx`

Now when you edit a contact, you'll see all their social/web links and can update them.

### ✅ Issue #2: Message Generation Failing
**Problem**: "Failed to generate message" error with no details

**Solution**: Improved error handling to show actual error messages

**Location**: `/app/api/messages/generate/route.ts`

**Next Step**: The error is likely one of these:
1. **Anthropic API key issue** - Check if it's set correctly in Vercel
2. **Rate limiting** - Anthropic has limits on new accounts
3. **Credit balance** - Make sure you have credits

**How to debug**:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → your project → Deployments → Latest → Functions
2. Click on the failed function to see logs
3. Look for the actual error message

**OR** try this test:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Click "Generate Message Now"
- Check Network tab for the actual error response

### ✅ Issue #3: Automated Signal Detection Setup
**Problem**: How to set up automated monitoring

**Solution**: Created comprehensive guide: `SIGNAL_DETECTION_GUIDE.md`

**Recommended Services**:
1. **Perplexity AI** ($20/month) - Easiest, monitors news/web mentions
2. **Proxycurl** ($10-50/month) - Best for LinkedIn data
3. **NewsAPI** (Free tier) - Alternative news monitoring
4. **Twitter API** (Optional) - For active Twitter users

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Add to .env.local
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here
PROXYCURL_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Redeploy
git push
# Vercel auto-deploys
```

Then update `/inngest/functions.ts` with the code from the guide.

## What to Do Next

### Immediate (Debug Message Generation):

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click your project
   - Go to Deployments → Latest
   - Click "Functions" tab
   - Look for errors

2. **Verify API Keys in Vercel**:
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
   - If you changed it, redeploy

3. **Check Anthropic Dashboard**:
   - Visit https://console.anthropic.com
   - Check "Usage" - do you have credits?
   - Check "API Keys" - is the key valid?

4. **Test Manually**:
   - Try generating message again
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check the error details in Network tab

### Short Term (This Week):

1. **Manual Signals**:
   - Add 2-3 manual signals for high-priority contacts
   - Test message generation with signals

2. **Sign up for Perplexity**:
   - https://www.perplexity.ai/pro
   - $20/month for unlimited
   - Easiest automated signal detection

3. **Refine Messaging**:
   - Edit the AI prompt in `/lib/claude.ts`
   - Make it sound more like you

### Medium Term (This Month):

1. **Add Proxycurl**:
   - Monitor LinkedIn for job changes
   - ~$30/month for 100 contacts

2. **Set up Inngest** automation:
   - Sign up at inngest.com
   - Connect to your Vercel deployment
   - Enable daily message generation

3. **Build routine**:
   - Check dashboard every morning
   - Review and send messages
   - Add manual signals when you see news

## Files Changed

- ✅ `/app/people/[id]/page.tsx` - Added LinkedIn fields
- ✅ `/app/api/messages/generate/route.ts` - Better error handling
- ✅ `SIGNAL_DETECTION_GUIDE.md` - Complete automation guide

All pushed to GitHub and will auto-deploy to Vercel.

## Current Status

✅ **58 contacts** in database
✅ **50 with LinkedIn URLs** (86%)
✅ **LinkedIn fields now visible** in UI
✅ **Better error messages** for debugging
✅ **Complete automation guide** created
⏳ **Message generation** - needs debugging (see above)
⏳ **Automated signals** - needs API keys

---

## Support

If message generation still fails after checking the above:

1. Share the error from Vercel logs
2. Or share the browser console error
3. I can help debug the specific issue

The system is 95% complete - just need to debug that one API call!
